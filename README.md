# Marginal
---

Calculates the margin of error for polynomial regression problems.

This Crate has three use cases:

* Given a calibration signal (concentration as a function of measured signal) for N measurement devices in an N gas problem, calculates the calibration profile.
* Given a calibration profile and an associated single-time measurement calculates the concentrations with margin of error.
* Given a set of detector designs calculates the minimum path length necessary to hit a given sensitivity.
